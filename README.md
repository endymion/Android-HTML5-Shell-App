# Android HTML5 Shell App

Android app that displays a web site full-screen using a WebKit view. Please do the world a favor and don't use this
unless the web site that you're embedding has good support for mobile devices. I recommend [jQuery
Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) as an easy way to add mobile support to any web site.

## Forking and Branching

I suggest forking this project on GitHub, and then creating a Git branch for each separate web site that you want to wrap in a shell app.

## Building

The simplest way to build this app is with Eclipse.  Import the app with File->Import..., and then select General->Existing Projects into Workspace.

## Customizing

Edit src/com/android_html5_shell_app to change the URL.
